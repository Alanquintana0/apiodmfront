This is the front-end project that will connect to our back-end project, creating an AGILE methodology project manager. It will feature functionalities such as user login, registration, task boards, and task creation, among others. This project serves as the final part of our Web Platforms course.

For the back-end, we have built an API using Node.js, Express, and JavaScript. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to execute JavaScript on the server-side. Express is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of server-side applications and APIs.

The API provides endpoints for user authentication, registration, and managing project tasks. It handles requests from the front-end, interacts with the database, and sends back the necessary data. We have implemented secure authentication using techniques such as hashing and salting passwords to protect user information.

On the front-end side, we have used Vue.js, a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js allows us to create dynamic and responsive web applications with ease. We have organized the project into components to promote reusability and maintainability.

The front-end communicates with the back-end API through HTTP requests, sending and receiving data in JSON format. It uses the Vue Router to handle navigation between different views and the Vuex state management library to manage the application's global state.

Overall, this project combines the power of Node.js, Express, JavaScript, and Vue.js to create a robust and user-friendly AGILE project management system.
